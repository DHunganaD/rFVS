#'         
#' @param stopPointCode is the integer value of the FVS stop point. If NA, no stop point is defined. 
#'   The stop point codes are:
#'   \tabular{cl}{
#'     0 \tab  Never stop. \cr
#'    -1 \tab  Stop at every stop location.\cr 
#'    1  \tab Stop just before the first call to the Event Monitor.\cr 
#'    2  \tab Stop just after the first call to the Event Monitor.\cr
#'    3  \tab Stop just before the second call to the Event Monitor.\cr
#'    4  \tab Stop just after the second call to the Event Monitor.\cr
#'    5  \tab Stop after growth and mortality has been computed, but prior to applying them.\cr
#'    6  \tab Stop just before the ESTAB routines are called.\cr
#'    7  \tab Stop just after input is read but before missing values are imputed 
#'       (tree heights and crown ratios, for example) and model calibration (argument 
#'        stopPointYear is ignored).\cr}
#' @param stopPointYear is the integer value of the year the stop should happen.	
#' @return the FVS return code where 
#' \tabular{cl}{
#' -1 \tab indicates that FVS has not been started \cr
#' 0  \tab indicates that FVS is in good running state \cr
#' 1  \tab indicates that FVS has detected \cr
#'         an error of some kind and should not be used until reset by specifying new input \cr 
#' 2  \tab indicates that FVS has finished processing all the stands; new input can be specified \cr}
